description:
    - Fetches details about one or multiple Compartment resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    - Lists the compartments in a specified compartment. The members of the list
      returned depends on the values set for several parameters.
    - With the exception of the tenancy (root compartment), the ListCompartments operation
      returns only the first-level child compartments in the parent compartment specified in
      `compartmentId`. The list does not include any subcompartments of the child
      compartments (grandchildren).
    - The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
      requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
      or indirectly (the resource can be in a subcompartment).
    - The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies only when you perform ListCompartments on the
      tenancy (root compartment). When set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
      To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
      set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ANY.
    - See L(Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID,https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five).
    - If I(compartment_id) is specified, the details of a single Compartment will be returned.

options:
    compartment_id:

            - The OCID of the compartment.

        type: str
    access_level:
        description:
            - Valid values are `ANY` and `ACCESSIBLE`. Default is `ANY`.
              Setting this to `ACCESSIBLE` returns only those compartments for which the
              user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions can be on a
              resource in a subcompartment). For the compartments on which the user indirectly has
              INSPECT permissions, a restricted set of fields is returned.
            - When set to `ANY` permissions are not checked.
        type: str
        choices:
            - "ANY"
            - "ACCESSIBLE"
    compartment_id_in_subtree:
        description:
            - Default is false. Can only be set to true when performing
              ListCompartments on the tenancy (root compartment).
              When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed
              and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are
              returned depending on the the setting of `accessLevel`.
