short_description: Perform actions on a Bucket resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
description:
    - Perform actions on a Bucket resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    - For I(action=make_bucket_writable), stops replication to the destination bucket and removes the replication policy. When the replication
      policy was created, this destination bucket became read-only except for new and changed objects replicated
      automatically from the source bucket. MakeBucketWritable removes the replication policy. This bucket is no
      longer the target for replication and is now writable, allowing users to make changes to bucket contents.
    - For I(action=reencrypt), re-encrypts the unique data encryption key that encrypts each object written to the bucket by using the most recent
      version of the master encryption key assigned to the bucket. (All data encryption keys are encrypted by a master
      encryption key. Master encryption keys are assigned to buckets and managed by Oracle by default, but you can assign
      a key that you created and control through the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Key Management service.) The kmsKeyId property
      of the bucket determines which master encryption key is assigned to the bucket. If you assigned a different Key Management
      master encryption key to the bucket, you can call this API to re-encrypt all data encryption keys with the newly
      assigned key. Similarly, you might want to re-encrypt all data encryption keys if the assigned key has been rotated to
      a new key version since objects were last added to the bucket. If you call this API and there is no kmsKeyId associated
      with the bucket, the call will fail.
      Calling this API starts a work request task to re-encrypt the data encryption key of all objects in the bucket. Only
      objects created before the time of the API call will be re-encrypted. The call can take a long time, depending on how many
      objects are in the bucket and how big they are. This API returns a work request ID that you can use to retrieve the status
      of the work request task.
      All the versions of objects will be re-encrypted whether versioning is enabled or suspended at the bucket.
