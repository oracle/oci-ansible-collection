                          configurations for how it should behave during processing for any given DNS query. When a rule has
                          no sequence of `cases`, it is always evaluated with the same configuration during processing. When
                          a rule has an empty sequence of `cases`, it is always ignored during processing. When a rule has a
                          non-empty sequence of `cases`, its behavior during processing is configured by the first matching
                          `case` in the sequence. When a rule has no matching cases the rule is ignored. A rule case with no
                          `caseCondition` always matches. A rule case with a `caseCondition` matches only when that expression
                          evaluates to true for the given query.
