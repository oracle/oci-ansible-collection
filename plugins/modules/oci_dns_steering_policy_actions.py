                  results when answering DNS queries.

                  using the `FILTER` rule first, then the following rules in succession: `HEALTH`, `PRIORITY`,
                  and `LIMIT`. This gives the domain dynamic failover capability."

                  a steering policy."

                  answers contingent upon `answer.isDisabled != true`, except for `CUSTOM`. A defined
                  `HEALTH` rule must follow the `FILTER` rule if the policy references a `healthCheckMonitorId`.
                  The last rule of a template must must be a `LIMIT` rule. For more information about templates
