    - Perform actions on a PublicIp resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    - For I(action=change_compartment), moves a public IP into a different compartment within the same tenancy. For information
      about moving resources between compartments, see
      L(Moving Resources to a Different Compartment,https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm#moveRes).
      This operation applies only to reserved public IPs. Ephemeral public IPs always belong to the
      same compartment as their VNIC and move accordingly.
