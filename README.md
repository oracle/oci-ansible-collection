# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible Collection - Beta


Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible Collection provides an easy way to provision and manage resources in Oracle Cloud using Ansible.

> **This collection replaces the [legacy modules](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-modules). Refer to the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/blob/master/MigrationGuide.md) for best migration practices.**

Ansible [released Collections](https://www.ansible.com/blog/getting-started-with-ansible-collections) as part of the Ansible 2.9 release. Ansible recommends Collections as the recommended method of packaging and releasing modules. 
With the creation of Oracle Cloud Ansible Collection, we are providing two user benefits:
 * **Faster Availability** - Oracle Cloud Ansible Modules will now be available to users at a faster pace on Ansible Galaxy. 
 * **Wider Coverage** - This summer, we aim to provide support for all the Oracle Cloud resources    
    
### Expected Change

Please expect a few [breaking changes](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/blob/master/MigrationGuide.md) as we transition from legacy modules to the new collection modules.
Also, the new modules are renamed to use the service name as a prefix.
We recommend you to refer to the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/blob/master/MigrationGuide.md) as you plan to migrate.

As we gradually make progress to provide full coverage of Oracle Cloud resources, you might not find all the familiar modules (that we support in the legacy modules) in the new collection.
In that case, you may choose to use the legacy modules as a workaround for the time being.

We have also added a new [User Guide](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/blob/master/UserGuide.md) to highlight new features and best practices for using the new modules.

## Installation

#### 1) Installing collections

You can use the [release tarball](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/releases) from Github:
  ``` bash
  $ ansible-galaxy collection install oracle-oci-{version}.tar.gz
  ```
Notes:
* Oracle Cloud collection will be released on Galaxy soon.
* Collections is supported in Ansible 2.9+.
* For more information about collections, please check [Ansible Collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html)

#### 2) Install OCI Python SDK

The Oracle Cloud Ansible modules are built using the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Python SDK](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/SDKDocs/pythonsdk.htm).

[Install OCI Python SDK](https://oracle-cloud-infrastructure-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#downloading-and-installing-the-sdk):

  ``` bash
  $ pip install oci
  ```
The modules honor the [SDK configuration](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/ToolsConfig.htm) when available.

## Samples

The project includes a catalog of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible module samples that illustrate using the modules 
to carry out common infrastructure provisioning and configuration tasks. The samples are organized in groups associated 
with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services under [the samples directory on GitHub](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/tree/master/samples).
Begin by reviewing the Readme.md file that you will find in each sample's root directory.

## Documentation

General documentation for legacy and new modules can be found [here](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/ansible.htm).
