# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible Collection

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible Collection provides an easy way to provision and manage resources in Oracle Cloud using Ansible.

> **This collection replaces the [legacy modules](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-modules). Refer to the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/blob/master/MigrationGuide.md) for best migration practices.**

Ansible [released Collections](https://www.ansible.com/blog/getting-started-with-ansible-collections) as part of the Ansible 2.9 release.
Ansible recommends Collections as the recommended method of packaging and releasing modules. 
With the creation of Oracle Cloud Ansible Collection, we are providing two user benefits:
 * **Faster Availability** - Oracle Cloud Ansible Modules will now be available to users at a faster pace on Ansible Galaxy. 
 * **Wider Coverage** - Support for the majority of the Oracle Cloud services.

We have also added a new [User Guide](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/blob/master/UserGuide.md) to highlight new features and best practices for using the new modules.

### Migration from Legacy Modules

We recommend migrating from the [legacy modules](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-modules) since they will be deprecated in the near future.
Please expect a few breaking changes while migrating from legacy modules to the new collection modules.
We recommend you to refer to the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/blob/master/MigrationGuide.md) for breaking changes.
Also, the new modules are renamed to use the service name as a prefix.

#### Currently Supported Services 
We support almost all the of [OCI Cloud services](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/services.htm) with very few exceptions.
For the complete list of supported services, please check the [modules list](https://oci-ansible-collection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collections/oracle/oci/index.html).

## Installation

#### 1) Installing the Collection with yum

You can use yum to install the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible Module Collection RPM.

The RPM installs the OCI Ansible module collection and its required dependencies: the OCI SDK for Python and Ansible.

The following example shows how to use yum to install the Ansible Module Collection RPM:
  ``` bash
$ yum -y install oraclelinux-developer-release-el7 && sudo yum install oci-ansible-collection
  ```
Note:
This installation uses Python version 3.6.

To test the installation of the RPM and configuration of the SDK, you can run a sample playbook. For example:
  ``` bash
$ ansible-playbook-3 /usr/share/doc/oci-ansible-collection-<version>/samples/object_storage/get_namespace/sample.yaml
  ```

#### 2) Installing collections from Ansible Galaxy

You can install it from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/oracle) using the command:
  ``` bash
  $ ansible-galaxy collection install oracle.oci
  ```
Notes:
* Collections is supported in Ansible 2.9+.
* For more information about collections, please check [Ansible Collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html)
* To update the modules to latest version, use the install --force flag.

#### Install OCI Python SDK

The Oracle Cloud Ansible modules are built using the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Python SDK](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/SDKDocs/pythonsdk.htm).

[Install OCI Python SDK](https://oracle-cloud-infrastructure-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#downloading-and-installing-the-sdk):

  ``` bash
  $ yum -y install oraclelinux-developer-release-el7 && yum -y install python-oci-sdk
  or
  $ pip install oci
  ```
The modules honor the [SDK configuration](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/ToolsConfig.htm) when available.

#### For more info about installation and troubleshooting check the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/blob/master/InstallationGuide.md).

## Samples and Solutions

The project includes a catalog of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible module samples that illustrate using the modules 
to carry out common infrastructure provisioning and configuration tasks.
* The samples are organized in groups associated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services under [the samples directory on GitHub](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/tree/master/samples).
Begin by reviewing the Readme.md file that you will find in each sample's root directory.
* The solutions are available under [the solutions directory on GitHub](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/tree/master/solutions)
