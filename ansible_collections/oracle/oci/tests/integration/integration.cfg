# This option preserves variable types during template operations. This requires Jinja2 >= 2.10.
# By default, all values returned from jinja filters are strings.  This means the following syntax in our 
# tests will return a string, which is a problem:
# "{{ 10 | oracle.oci.override(test_var_name, omit) }}" -> "10"
# This setting enables jinja filters to preserve types, so the value returned above will be an int.
# Note: For fields where the module has explicitly declared the parameter type this ends up not mattering
# because ansible will automatically convert the param value from "10" to 10 if it is declared as an int.
# Some parameters are nested in such a way that we cannot declare their types expicitly and that is where
# we need this setting to prevent everything from being turned into a string (see load_balancer.listeners
# suboptions)
